Run the demo server using "ant server".  Then navigate to localhost:8081/ in 
order to read the documentation.  The "Java docs" link takes you to documentation
for the Java GUI code that you will use to build your Catan client.  The
"Interactive Server API" link will take you to the server's Swagger page, which
allows you to interactively call the server's web API methods, and documents
the inputs and outputs of the server's methods.  The other links on the server's
documentation page are not relevant to the version of the project you are doing.


Run the demo client using "ant client".


Run your server using "ant our-server".


Run your client using "ant our-client".


There are example JSON files under the 'sample' folder.  These are examples 
of the JSON objects used to make requests to the server, and to return the 
game state (i.e., client model) to the client.  You can also see the syntax
for the server's JSON inputs and outputs on the server's Swagger page,
with additional details being provide in the document titled "Server Web API 
Documentation".
